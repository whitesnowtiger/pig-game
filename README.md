A Pig Game

This is a game that I coded as I took the online course, JavaScript Complete Course 2019 by jonasschmedtmann.

-The Rule of the Game-

Two players take a turn to play the game. The blue dot shows who's turn it is. Each turn, a player rolls dices as many times as he wishes. Each score(current) before you click 'Hold' will added to your final score. The goal of the game is to get 100 points first. However, if you roll a '1', you will lose all your current points. If you roll two '6', you will lose all your final score. You can also change the final score to win. The default final score is 100.
